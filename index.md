I am originally from Melbourne and I moved up to Canberra about three years ago for work. I have a Master of Law and work as a Privacy Lawyer for a Government Department. I enjoy playing and watching sport such as Australian Rules Football and soccer. 

## Interest in IT

My interest in IT is building computers, connecting networks, programming and for work cybersecurity. My interest in IT developed when I was in high school and built my first desktop computer tower. From there, I studied IT at high school and programming in Python and HTML as a breadth subject at university.  There was no single event that sparked my interest in IT as it has evolved over time. My IT experience is basic programming in Python and HTML, being able to connect hardware together including building desktop computer towers, connecting and crimping ethernet cables  to create wall sockets and interacting with the cybersecurity team in my department providing advice on how personal information is managed under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). 

I chose to study at RMIT for a range of reasons. It was the ease of being able to study online and flexibility in being able to choose a time during the week that I can study around work and my other commitments. Furthermore, having being from Melbourne I had a few high school friends study at RMIT engineering and IT courses and they gave praise as to how their experience was at RMIT.

From my study of this subject I hope to gather a broad understanding of the IT industry and hopefully narrow down avenues that I wish to pursue. I expect to learn from RMIT knowledge to possibly transition into an IT career or depending on the outcome of this subject and the avenue that I choose, a greater understanding of the growing IT industry so that I am more readily able to interact with and understand it.

### Description of the position and what makes it appealing to me

A Cyber  Security Consultant is an advisor and guide. A consultant, will be able to design and implement the best security solutions for an organisation, company or government agency needs. They interact with stakeholders, draw up budgets, supervise teams, and research. They conduct security tests and probe for vulnerabilities. They have good technical and interpersonal skills. I am drawn by the position’s mix of requiring technical knowledge as well as leadership and negotiation skills. I am also drawn in dealing with people such as experts and clients to develop the best solution to the secure the data. 

### Description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position

Cyber Security Consultants must be deeply familiar with risk management tools and develop a solution to optimise data protection. Estimates vary but three to seven years is in the field is usually required before Security Consultants are hired. A bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Cyber Security or a related field is required. Strong leadership and negotiation skills and communication abilities are required. For technical expertise knowledge of information security management frameworks are essential. For example in this job some of the frameworks acronyms listed are the Essential Eight by the Australian Signals Directorate, ISO/IEC 27001by both the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the Victorian Protective Data Security Framework by the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner. The position also requires security management certification. Certification is gained by various ways and through different organisations, however,  the vast majority require sitting exams. 

### Description of my skills, qualifications and experience that I have in relation to the positon

Other than having strong negotiation and good communication skills obtained from my background in law and work interacting with stakeholders and IT experts, I lack a lot of the technical skills required to be a Cyber Security Consultant. 
A plan describing how I will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience
As mentioned a crucial qualification for a Cyber Security Consultant is obtaining a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. This is something that I would require and can be obtained by continuing to studying this current course. Experience for between three to seven years can be obtained through completion of this degree and working in the IT industry such as in a technical support role. The certification would come through studying which is the most appropriate for the roles that I am considering and accordingly applying to sit the relevant exam to obtain the qualification. 

## Personal Profile

Results of the Myer-Briggs test:
-	personality type is: Consul
-	76% extraverted
-	61% observant
-	61% feeling
-	61% tactics
-	53% assertive

Results of the Learning styles test:
-	Kinesthetic 69
-	Visual 51
-	Auditory 49

Results of the TypeFinder Personality test:
-	63% extraverted
-	51% intuition
-	55% feeling
-	60% judging
-	Personality code types:  ‘The Teacher’ and ‘The Provider’

### What the results mean to me

The results show that as I tend to be more extraverted where I am energised by engaging with others and generally enjoy interacting with people. I also tend to be more feeling  where I value empathy, cooperation and compassion. I also believe that everyone has a responsibility to take care of those around them. I believe that these traits are accurately portrayed. My learning style preference is learning by doing. I agree with that, whilst I believe passive learning such as watching a lecture and reading is important I think that the best way to test what I have learnt is by actually doing it or, where possible, testing the boundaries. For example instead of watching someone programming, which is helpful to understand the principles, actually programming and testing different things is more beneficial to me than watching. 

### How these results may influence my behaviour in a team

As a more extraverted person I should allow other people in the team have their say and be open and more willing to listen to them.  I believe as a more feeling person I should be able to use this to support others in the team. I don’t have any issues with people adapting different learning styles to my own as I believe that everyone’s learning styles are different and that it is up to each person to identify what is best for them.  I also note that the tests are not decisive as an example in the Myer-Briggs test I was found to be more observant whilst in the TypeFinder Personality I was more intuitive. As the difference is about 10% there is probably are margin of difference between the tests but it probably doesn’t mean that anyone is fixed in a specific category if they are close to either trait. 

### How I would take this into account when forming a team

I believe that the best team is one that has people with differing traits as it brings a wealth of knowledge, experience and points of view. A product that can take into consideration the most of people’s concerns is likely to be popular with the population. However, it is not possible to obtain everyone’s personality and learning tests results and mix and match. Even if this were possible it would not happen in most situations where a team is formed in the workplace as usually such teams are formed based on the person’s experience and skills for the project and not on their personality. In considering this I believe that the best way to continue with a team is to understand everyone’s personality traits and work on the project in the best way that utilises the best traits and skills. 

## Project Idea

### Overview

The project is an App on Android devices that stops text message notifications when you are driving and can be set up to send an automatic response such as ‘I am currently driving and will respond to you shortly’. The App can also be used to locate your parked car when a person clicks a button when their car is parked using GPS and the street position. This is stored and it can be retrieved from the App when it is time to go back to the car. 

### Motivation

It is illegal to operate a mobile phone whilst driving in Australia. Limited functions such as GPS on the mobile phone be used as long as it secure secured in a commercially designed holder. All other functions (including video calls, texting, emailing, task management, photography, social media, shopping and share economy apps) are prohibited.  Furthermore, a the reason that it is not legal to text and drive is provide by a September 2015 fact sheet co-authored by  Motor Accident Insurance Commission and the Queensland University of Technology.  Reports have indicated that driver distraction is one of the main causes of road crashes, accounting for approximately 1 in 4 car crashes , furthermore, using a mobile phone whilst driving is highly distracting and increases risks of a crash by four-fold.  Despite the dangers and illegality, approximately 25% of surveyed Queensland drivers reported using their hand-held mobile phone on a daily basis to answer or make calls, as well as read text messages, while 14% reported using their hand-held phone to send a text message on a daily basis.  The App is designed to limit the distraction to the driver and provide some positive utility in the form of a parked car locator. 

#### Description

The App will need to have capability to turn on and off the message function when the App is entered into. It will also need to have a function to set up an automatic response message or a turn off this functionality. Finally the App will need to access GPS and Google Maps to save a cars location and be able to display this location when required. In short the App will have a main menu with three options; one for turning on and off the text message function, two to set up or disable the automatic text message response and three enter the car find function to choose to enter the location of the car by a click of a button or find the car using another platform like Google Maps. Depending on the difficulty of the skill required the project will also try to integrate both stopping text messages and parking location functions. As it is likely that the App would be running when the user clicks the park location button which allows the text messages to be viewed by the person, alternatively the person can exit the app to view the text messages.

### Tools and Technologies 

The project will require programming to create the App, depending on the technical difficulty of this it may be more realistic to use something like an App Inventor such as (http://www.appinventor.org/). The hardware is any Android device that has the capability to run the APP and has SMS and GPS functionality. 

### Skills required

Java skills are required for programming Android Apps. Depending on the difficulty it may not be possible to programme the entire App using purely Java programming. Therefore, if it is not feasible to program the App using Java an App Inventor will need to be used to overcome this. Testing the App can occur on any Android device that has the capability to run the APP and has SMS and GPS functionality.

### Outcome

If the project is successful there will be an App that limits one of the main distraction to drivers on Australian roads which can lead to accidents. It will also allow users to record and locate their parked cars which will be useful in unfamiliar areas to the driver.
